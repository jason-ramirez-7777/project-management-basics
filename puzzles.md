#### Q. There is a room with a door (closed) and three light bulbs. Outside the room there are three switches, connected to the bulbs. You may manipulate the switches as you wish, but once you open the door you can’t change them. Identify each switch with its bulb.

Let the bulbs be X, Y and Z

Turn on switch X for 5 to 10 minutes. Turn it off and turn on switch Y. Open the door and touch the light bulb.

#### Q. There are 4 persons (A, B, C and D) who want to cross a bridge in night.

1. A takes 1 minute to cross the bridge.
1. B takes 2 minutes to cross the bridge.
1. C takes 5 minutes to cross the bridge.
1. D takes 8 minutes to cross the bridge.

There is only one torch with them and the bridge cannot be crossed without the torch. There cannot be more than two persons on the bridge at any time, and when two people cross the bridge together, they must move at the slower person’s pace.

Can they all cross the bridge in 15 minutes?

**Solution**: 
Step 1: A and B cross the bridge. A comes back. Time taken 3 minutes. Now B is on the other side.
Step 2: C and D cross the bridge. B comes back. Time taken 8 + 2 = 10 minutes. Now C and D are on the other side.
Step 3: A and B cross the bridge. Time taken is 2 minutes. All are on the other side.

Total time spent: 3 + 10 + 2 = 15 minutes.
