#### Q. What are the scientific ways to do project estimation?

There are many different types of estimation techniques used in project management with various streams like Engineering, IT, Construction, Agriculture, Accounting, etc. A Project manager is often challenged to align mainly six project constraints - **Scope**, **Time**, **Cost**, **Quality**, **Resources** and **Risk** in order to accurately estimate the project. The common questions that come into the mind of a project manager at the start of the project are â€“

* How much work is to be estimated (scope)
* How to estimate the project (techniques)
* How much time it will require to complete the project (Schedule)
* Who will be doing the project (resources)
* What is the budget required to deliver the project (cost)
* Any intermediary dependencies that may delay or impact the project (Risks).
